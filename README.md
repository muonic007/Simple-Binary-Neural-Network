# Simple Binary Neural Network 🧠🔁

This is a basic feedforward neural network implemented from scratch using NumPy. The model supports **binary classification** problems and allows users to define the **number of hidden layers** and **neurons per layer** interactively.

### 🧩 Features:
- Written completely in Python and NumPy
- User-defined architecture (layers, neurons)
- ReLU and Sigmoid activations
- Cross-entropy loss
- Works on any numeric binary classification dataset (e.g., breast cancer dataset)

### 🚀 Example Dataset:
Uses the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#breast-cancer-dataset) preprocessed with MinMax scaling and label encoding.

### 📦 Dependencies:
```bash
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
